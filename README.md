# KochCurveGenerator
Creates a Koch snowflake with user desired level and angle.
Installation Instructions:

1. If your system doesn't have Python installed, install Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Navigate to your Python "Lib" folder and add graphics.py from this repository to it
3. The Koch Curve Generator is now ready to run


Instructions to Run and Use:

1. Open any Python IDE, shell will work fine.
2. Run kochCurve.py
3. Enter your desired level, the value defaults to 5 which is the best trade off between speed and image quality
4. Enter your desired theta value, this is the angle of the two isoscelese corners of the triangles made in the snowflake. The value defaults to 60 which creates a more traditional Koch snoflake.
